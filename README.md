Princeton Club Directory 
This repository contains code used to create a website for Princeton University which allows students to view all of the clubs on campus in a more streamlined way than was previously available. The old site contained a lot of outdated information and was difficult to navigate, my team Zyanne Clay-Hubbard, Jonah Lytle, Richard Wolf, Jacob Schachner, and I, scraped the data from the old site, barring the outdated information, and added new features like filtering checkboxes for days of the week and type of club, as well as a search bar. Additionally, we added dual authentication to the site using DUO, which allowed us to identify users and determine if they were club admins or not. Club admins automatically had an additional page they could navigate to that would allow them to update their information on the site, where previously they would have had to email the Princeton Office of the Dean of Undergraduate students, to have them edit their infromation indirecty.
